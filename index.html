      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Gokul A, a recent graduate passionate about software development and coding. I have a strong foundation in 
        Java, Data Structures, and Algorithms, and I'm eager to apply my skills in a professional setting. 
        Although I’m at the beginning of my career, I’ve dedicated myself to learning and honing my programming abilities through 
        various coding challenges and academic projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am deeply interested in software development and have gained proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 
        problem-solving, and algorithm design. I’m constantly working on improving my skills, and I’m excited about starting my 
        professional journey as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my portfolio, you’ll find more about my skills, academic achievements, and my journey to becoming a software developer. 
        I’m looking forward to contributing to innovative projects and growing in a team-oriented environment.
